# R4DS_final_final
This project is my finals project for R4DS course given by Ozan Bakis in Bahcesehir University. In this project, we wanted to show whether employee numbers are important in sales, profit margin, market cap and personnel expense. This project does not consists econometric analysis, as I haven't learned, but I plan to continue to this project and add an econometric analysis to our plots and summary tables as my knowledge about econometrics and R continues to increase. For any questions and suggestions, feel free to contact me from github, twitter or my linkedin. #rstats
